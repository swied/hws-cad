I have uploaded the code from a GitLab repository.  This code was written mostly in java, runs in the JVM, and displays as a webapp in the browser.  I would like to completely refactor this code to run as a modern React webapp.  I don't want there to be any Java code remaining.  I know Python well, and think that is the best tool for some scientific computing taskes.  It is ok if some of the Python code is retained.  I want to retain as much of the original functionality of the code as possible.  Please create a new repository schema for this refactored code.  In the `README.md` file please display the new file schema, and all of the instructions details.  I have one request that you include a comment at or near the top of evary file with the file name.
