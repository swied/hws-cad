# Hollow Wooden Surfboard Design Web App

I would like to build my own web app that works in a browser. I think I will need to use the Electron framework. The app that I would like to build is a 3D CAD app for the specific purpose of designing surfboards. Once the design is finished then I would like to be able to make and print out cross sections of the board. This will be so that I can reproduce the design using wood. My end goal is the build a hollow wooden surfboard. I want to do the entire process end-to-end by myself -- including building the 3D CAD software. 

# Coding Language Preferences 

I haven't used Electron before. I am comfortable the Python and Javascript programming languages. I would prefer is most of the code for calculating splines, and projects be done using Python.  However, I understand that I will need to use other languages in order to build an Electron web app

# Coding style guide

Since this is a personal project, I am not too worried creating a polished and artistically designed user interface.  I am mostly concerned with maximizing functionality.

However, I do want the code architecture to be professional and follow industry best practices.  I want the code to be well documented with comments.  I wish to use the Google docstring format for commenting.  Don't be afraid to be too verbose in your comments.  I want the documentation to be extremely thourough.  Please include examples in the comments for everything.

# Step-by-step approach

- Step 1: As a first step will you plese get me started with designing the file schema.  I will be adding this code to my GitHub repository.
- Step 2: Next please create the code for all of the most important and fundamental files needed for this Electron Web App to run.
- Step 3: Please create a README.md file with complete instructions on how to install and run this app.
- Step 4: Please provide a project plan and instructions on the next steps for me to complete the software development portion of this project.

Note, that I am developing this app on an Ubuntu Linux machine running the Chrome browser.  I would like this Web app to eventually run cross-platform and cross-browser.
